#
# this config file will save various reports of vital system information.
# by default, all the reports are enabled and are saved in /var/backups.
#
# (1) a list of all the packages installed and removed.
#     this file can be used to restore the state of installed packages
#     by running "dpkg --set-selections < dpkg-selections.txt
# 
# (2) the partition table of all disks. 
#     this partition table can be used to format another disk of
#     the same size. this can be handy if using software raid and 
#     you have a disk go bad. just replace the disk and partition it
#     by running "sfdisk /dev/sdb < partitions.sdb.txt" 
#     (MAKE SURE YOU PARTITION THE CORRECT DISK!!!)
#
# (3) hardware information. 
#     a simple report is generated of the kernel modules, the devices,
#     and the model of the hardware which 'discover' is able to detect.
#

# here are the defaults, commented out:

# packages = yes 
# packagesfile = /var/backups/dpkg-selections.txt

partitions = no
# partitionsfile = /var/backups/partitions.*.txt

hardware = no
# hardwarefile = /var/backups/hardware.txt
